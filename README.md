# Limble Tree

An Angular library for creating highly dynamic drag-and-drop tree structures

## About

### Limble

Limble is a CMMS SaaS company providing great software to customers around the world. The `limble-tree` library is built by the Limble team and used in Limble's web applications.

### Status

This library is currently in **beta** development. It may not be ready for use in a production environment.

## Demo

(requires node and npm)

To view the demo:

1. clone/download this repo
2. run `npm ci`
3. run `npm run start`
4. Open your browser to `localhost:4200`

## Installation and Usage

See [the package README](https://github.com/LimbleCMMS/limble-tree/blob/main/projects/limble-tree/README.md) or the [NPM page](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@limble/limble-tree)

## Development

### Requirements

-  node
-  npm
-  npx

### Suggested Dev Setup

I find that the best way to develop this library is to run `npx ng build limble-tree --watch` in one terminal and then run `npx ng serve sandbox` on a second terminal. This will rebuild the library on changes, and also serves the demo app, so you can immediately view and experiment on your changes.

## Issues, Feature Requests, Etc

If you find an issue or you would like to see an improvement, you may create an "issue" or start a "discussion" here in github.

We truly appreciate feedback; but keep in mind that we, the Limble team, built this library for our own needs, and requests from outside our organization may not always be a high priority.
